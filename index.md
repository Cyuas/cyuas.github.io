Hi. I'm Rachel Cooper. I'm an AI Engineer at [MITRE], helping to solve problems for a safer world.
At heart, I am a Machine Learning and Human Factors enthusiast, with a desire to advocate for explainable AI.
In my free time, I enjoy camping and hiking, making and playing music, and experiencing interactive media.
